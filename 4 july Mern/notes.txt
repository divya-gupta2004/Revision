Typed language (requires declaration of variables and its type) : C, C++, JavaScript
  
  - it has datatype safety
                eg: int x;

Non - typed language (does not requires declaration of variables and its type): JS, Python, PHP
 - we just initialize the variable and does not declare its datatype
 - it does not have datatype safety
            eg: x = 45;
                x = "mahdms";
                x = 56.47;
